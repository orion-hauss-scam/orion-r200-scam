## Orion Projectors is a scam

This is a scam. It is not a high end projector brand. It is a Chinese knockoff. Worthless $0

Orion R200 or R800 are both Chinese junk projectors. They are NOT worth $1000's that the scammer is suggesting. AVOID

## Orion Projectors are WORTHLESS

Don't throw away your money on junk thinking you are getting a good deal.

These Chinese versions are made with cheap and dangerous materials.

## The bulb contains mercury and are known to start fires!

The reason you cannot find any other information about it besides a FAKE brand website is because these are knock offs. They create a fake brand website to trick you into thinking it is legit. This is FAKE!
